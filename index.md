# Short Bio
I'm currently a Ph.D candidate in Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Before that, I received my B.S. degree (2017) and M.E. degree (2020) in East China Normal University, respectively. From 2020 to 2022, I was employed in the Institute of Financial Technology, China UnionPay. My current research interest includes **Graph Neural Network**, as well as its **interpretability** and application, e.g., **Drug Design**, **Electronics Design Automation (EDA)**, **Quantitative Trading**, and **Social Network Analysis**.
